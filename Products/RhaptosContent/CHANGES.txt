RhaptosContent-0.40
  - light-weight-branding (30 Oct 2009)
    - Viewing a lens page now sets (or updates) a cookie with a unique list of lenses visited.
      Then, content_render.xsl has javascript that detects if this module is in one of the lenses
      in the cookie (by navigating the DOM tree) and displays an ugly banner
    - Banner colors, title, and whether a logo exists are stored in the cookie and
      (aside from the logo) rendered.
    - branding bar message needs to change based on lens category: {Endorsement, Affiliation}.
    - branding logo now happens for collections and modules.
    - Adding styling to CNX look and Rhaptos look for branding bar and
      logo. Removed unused class from JS and converted another class into a more appropriate ID
    - Fixing issues with padding in Rhaptos look and font-size in both
      looks. Removing styling for #cnx_branding_logo in ploneCustom.css
      files because that <div> shouldn't show up on the lens listing
      page. Remove branding header from ploneCustom.css files because I
      don't have such headers for anything else in those files (and don't
      want to imply that everything under them is related to branding).
    - Javascript now loads at the bottom of the page, and is inserted when Ext.onReady
      is fired, not immediately; so there is flicker.

      - bottom_content_actions added; does the same, but for non-JS (and bottom of page)
      - dynamic.js has JS for menu action
      - lens operations called in root context instead of content context
    - one content_template now works for both Rhaptos and CNX: removed the redundant CNXContent version
    - "book" image added to modules in collection context
